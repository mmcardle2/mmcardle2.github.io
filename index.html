<h1>My Roommate's Cat Oliver</h1>
<h2>Who is Oliver?</h2>
<h3>Physical Description</h3>
<p>Oliver is a very cute short/medium haired tuxedo cat with <b><span style="color:brown">brown</span></b> and
<b><span style="color:green">green</span></b> eyes. His pupils dilate or constrict with the brightness of the room
unless he's in a playful mood, then his pupils will be very dilated and his eyes open as wide as they can go.
He has white 'socks' on all four of his feet and a white stomach.
Oliver has very long whiskers, both to the sides of his mouth/nose and above his eyes like eyebrows.</p>
<h3>Where He's From</h3>
<p>My roommate adopted him from a foster parent who had several dogs, cats, and birds. He was adopted when
 he was 6 months old. We think his busy and crowded childhood is what influenced him to be such an
 unusually social and easy-going cat. He was very <small>tiny</small> when we got him, but he's 
really grown into his size.</p>
<h2>Oliver's Future</h2>
<p>My roommate and I are living together for this school year and the next, after which we will both
 graduate. She will stay in Madison with Oliver and go to grad school, while I will likely move for my
  career, leaving Oliver behind. It may be difficult for him, with his outgoing personality, to
 go from four people in the house to only one, but by then he will be older and less active.</p>
